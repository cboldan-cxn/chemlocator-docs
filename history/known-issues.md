# Known issues

The following issues are known, and will be addressed in future releases.


**Issue: indexing logs screen's filter by URL feature behaves in an unintuitive manner**

When filtering by URL on the indexing logs screen, the URL matches are simply 
sorted to the top, instead of the results being limited to just matches.


**Issue: reset index link on the processing status page broken**

There is a link for convenience on the processing status page which should 
take the user to the Index Reset screen, but currently does not.  The navigation
menu's Index Reset link can be used as a work around.
